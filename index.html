                The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have come up with several models predicting how COVID-19 could spread within the United States. Unfortunately, none of these models are available to the public. We decided to create our own models of possible
                spread in the United States. We hope our models can help you understand how quickly the virus might spread, how many people it might infect, and how long it might last.
            </p>
            <p>
                We based our analysis off of the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Kermack-McKendrickModel.html" target="_blank">Kermack-McKendrick logistic model</a> a, a SIR model for the number of people infected in an illness in a closed population
                over time. Note that our analysis is just a prediction, as there are many factors that contribute to the spread of a disease.

                Coronavirus is mainly spread through respiratory droplets. Remember to cover your coughs and sneezes, wash your hands, and stay home if you are sick. Face masks are not recommended unless you are contagious. You should seek medical attention if you are
                having difficulty breathhing or have a fever of 101ºF or higher. More information can be found on the
                <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank">CDC website.</a>

                The first model we made was a SIR model, which stands for susceptibles, infectives, and removed.
                <ol>
                    <li>Susceptible: Those who could become infected</li>
                    <li>Infective: Those who have the disease and can transmit it</li>
                    <li>Removed: Those who cannot become infected or transmit the disease</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                We also made three more models based on the outbreaks in China, South Korea, and Italy. We chose these countries because they are developed countries that exhibit varying levels of infectiousness. The United States outbreak could follow any one of them.

                China reported 8 new cases yesterday, bringing their total number of confirmed cases to 80,792.
