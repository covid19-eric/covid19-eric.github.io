                China reported 26 new cases yesterday, a 0.03% increase that brings their total confirmed cases to 80,826. It is important to note a large increase in cases between days 22 and 23 (2/12-2/13) that resulted from a new diagnosis method. While their medical
                system was quickly overwhelmed at first, China's infrastructure allowed for a quick response, including a new hospital built in just days. Additionally, the government completely shut down Wuhan and put in place national restrictions,
                and this was a hugely successful quarantine effort. Unfortunately, it was at the cost of their economy. This <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/chinese-annual-gdp-growth-could-fall-below-2percent-economist-warns.html">CNBC
                    article</a> estimates that China's year-over-year economic growth could be under 2%, over a 67% decrease from 2019. As China plan reopens many of their businesses and schools in the coming weeks, we may see another increase in the
                number of confirmed cases.

                South Korea reported 107 new cases yesterday, a 1.34% increase that brings their total confirmed cases to 8,086. A large amount of these cases have been traced back to Shincheonji, which is a church in Seoul. In the first two weeks of the South Korean
                outbreak, about 60% of all cases were associated with the church. The government acted fast to shut down the church and is currently investigating the church. Additionally, South Korea quickly scaled the production of coronavirus testing
                kits, which many other countries have not been able to do.

                Italy reported 3,497 new cases yesterday, a 19.8% increase that brings their total confirmed cases to 21,157. It is important to note that Italy did not report any new cases between days 50 and 51 (3/11-3/12). This drastically increases the total number
                of cases predicted by the logistic regression model. We adjusted the number of cases according to new data in order to provide a better projection. The adjusted curves are shown above. Similar to China, Italy has shut down all schools
                non-essential businesses in an attempt to contain the outbreak. Unfortunately, this quarantine came too late, and Italy's healthcare system is currently overwhelmed. This has resulted in an unusually high mortality rate, at 8.16%.
